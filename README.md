My GitHub history is not very long, as most of my contributions have been through Meta. If you go to [Project Aria Tools Actions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/actions?page=6) and look at workflows from July 15 2024 or earlier, many of the updates with {Documentation} in the title have been created by me.

## How I approach Technical Writing
### Documentation is everywhere
I train, inspire and empower SMEs to create stronger documentation. Whether the content is for websites, manuals or in the code. The need for clear documentation, comments and docstrings will become stronger when LLMs interrogate code. LLMs can provide valuable insights, but only if the code is adequately documented.

### Greenfield or legacy documentation
I use data based decision making, stakeholder engagement and content marketing strategies to create documentation, training and websites. Breaking ground for new products or transforming old content into revitalized experiences.

### Your organization is unique
I thrive learning about new processes, software, and what matters to your experts and audiences. To write effectively for an organization, it's essential to listen deeply and get hands on experience with their products.



## As a human
Paraphrased from [lizargall.com](https://lizargall.com)

I think you are rad. You look at the tough stuff in the world and keep caring. We like joy, curiosities, and a little gallows humor to keep edges we don’t want smoothed off. It is hard to bring our best selves forward, as individuals, as organizations, as makers of change in a world where hearts get frayed. It may be hard, but it can be fun, and it doesn’t have to be alone.

We need lots of ways to reknit ourselves if we are to walk through the world with kindness and courage. I have tools and stories that help, as a technical writer, author, cartoonist, workshop facilitator, speechwriter and public speaker.

I write fantastic documentation. I write science fiction, fantasy, and work that yearns for better visions of our future and past. I create spaces of kindness. I create work that faces brutalities, stories that recognize pain and our messy struggles for connection. I make things that are just plain silly because we all need to let our inner shaggy sheepdog go galumph around in puddles and come dancing back with dirty paws.

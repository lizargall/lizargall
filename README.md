## As a human
Paraphrased from [lizargall.com](https://lizargall.com)

I think you are rad. You look at the tough stuff in the world and keep caring. We like joy, curiosities, and a little gallows humor to keep edges we don’t want smoothed off. It is hard to bring our best selves forward, as individuals, as organizations, as makers of change in a world where hearts get frayed. It may be hard, but it can be fun, and it doesn’t have to be alone.

We need lots of ways to reknit ourselves if we are to walk through the world with kindness and courage. I have tools and stories that help, as a technical writer, author, cartoonist, workshop facilitator, speechwriter and public speaker.

I write fantastic documentation. I write science fiction, fantasy, and work that yearns for better visions of our future and past. I create spaces of kindness. I create work that faces brutalities, stories that recognize pain and our messy struggles for connection. I make things that are just plain silly because we all need to let our inner shaggy sheepdog go galumph around in puddles and come dancing back with dirty paws.

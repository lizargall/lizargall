# Technical Writing is quite interesting!
I had a great conversation with Kate Mueller on the [Not Boring Technical Writer](https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/) podcast. The actual interview was a lot longer as we got quite carried away, so kudos to the editors for squeezing it down to size.

[Connecting permaculture and documentation with Liz Argall](https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/episodes/connecting-permaculture-and-documentation-with-liz-argall)

We cover a lot of ground in the episode, including how to help engineers overcome shame that can limit documentation, the glory of the right metrics used the right way and what can happen if you throw yourself into processes passionately. You'll see connections between what we spoke about and my recent [Attend to the Work](2025-06-18-process.mdx) blog post.

One of the bits that didn't make it into the episode was Kate telling me the term "Get curious when you get furious." Wise words indeed, even when forces might want to shut your brain down. I know intimately through my Aikido practice how much more powerful I can be when I have play on my mind. We know boxers are getting ready to be dangerous when they get a little loose and light in their body. Play, joy and curiosity are not passive things!

Right now, one of the ways I'm bringing joy and curiosity into my life is cofounding a community development organization in Uganda! You can listen to its technical writing origin story in the podcast and find out more on our website, [Ngombor Community Development Alliance](https://ngombor.my.canva.site/).

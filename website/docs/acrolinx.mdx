# Acrolinx - Demos and Training

### Problem
In 2017 AI SAAS was still a relatively new concept and [Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/) was working to express how it was a more powerful and whole of organization product than its nearest competitor, Grammarly. Onboarding new staff and organizations onto Acrolinx could be challenging and time consuming, as the training was either too high level and conceptual, or went into too much detail and could only be provided by the founder.

Acrolinx needed to move from simply being a “Super powered Grammarly you can run on dedicated servers that protects your IP,” to a whole of organization content governance tool that  enables you to audit content quality, manage risk and have your organization speak with one voice. 

Acrolinx clients covered a wide variety of sales verticals, including IT, banking and finance, pharmaceutical and healthcare, and aviation.  Acrolinx was particularly powerful in structured authoring environments and in regulatory environments where terminology management was essential.

### Actions
Created powerful demos that helped express the broader scope of Acrolinx, helping clients and potential clients understand how Acrolinx supports data-informed content governance, not just in context coaching at the writer/editor level.

    * Example of Acrolinx analysis and demo made for a potential customer, using their own sample documents.

Created training, and internal train the trainer training for Acrolinx. This covered how to use Acrolinx as an end user, but most importantly, it gave administrators the information they needed to understand the product, set up and maintain the product for their organization.

Championed how AI and human intelligences can work together in collaboration, not competition through presentations such as *Governance in Content: Draconian Overlord or Supportive Coach?* Using AI means we can leverage what computers for what they do best, such as eidetic memory, ability to be used at any time (even while in pajamas), and operating at scales that human minds aren't built for. It celebrates what makes human intelligences and relationships special and how AI can be used to free up capacity to find time to coach and mentor staff. It uses [Deloitte’s Simply Irresistible Organization model](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/human-capital/at-is-your-organization-simply-irresistible.pdf) as an organizing principle.

### Outcomes

Demos helped to gain new customers (100K minimum) and ensure several 1M contracts were renewed. These demos generally involved doing a content analysis on the customer’s own content. This content could be in documents, websites or structured authoring/content systems (Oxygen, AEM etc.). As part of this analysis I was able to identify deprecated terminology and use of terms that legal had determined exposed the organization to risk. We were able to provide clients and prospective clients with direct paths to content that had low content scores (based on their own criteria) and forbidden terminology, leading to immediately actionable content improvements.

The Train the Trainer content I created was particularly powerful, helping Acrolinx staff onboard organizations and provide more effective user support. This helped to enable the founder to return to research, instead of being stuck in the churn of onboarding and troubleshooting.

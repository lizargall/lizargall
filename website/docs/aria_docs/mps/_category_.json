Through Machine Perception Services (MPS), research partners can generate Eye Gaze, SLAM (trajectory, semi-dense point clouds and calibration data), Multi-SLAM (SLAM data from multiple Aria devices in a shared world location) and Hand Tracking derived data. Open data releases also contain MPS data. Go to https://explorer.projectaria.com/ to view interactive visualizations of MPS data using Rerun."

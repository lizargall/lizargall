# Project Aria Research Kit Release Notes

:::info Writing Sample
This page is based on technical writing I did for Project Aria. Some of the links will be broken, as I did not bring across the whole site. For the most up to date documentation go to [Project Aria Docs](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro).
:::

:::tip Evolving the SW Release Notes
Drawing on my experience creating SW Release Notes for Halo Infinite, I introduced much more robust SW Release Notes. I created a consistent structure and championed adding Known Issues and Bug Fixes to our release notes. Over time, engineers came to see that communicating with our users around Known Issues and Bug Fixes helped us demonstrate that we were listening, provided transparency around our practices, and provided valuable information to User Support.
:::

These SW Release notes are for the Aria Research Kit (ARK), and are for Meta SW that supports Academic Research Partners using Project Aria glasses. To find out how to become a research partner, go to [projectaria.com](https://projectaria.com).

Our Open Source Project Aria Tools SW Release notes are posted to [Project Aria Tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools), using Tags > Releases.

## July 2024
### **Mobile Companion App v170 and Time Synchronized Recordings Between Multiple Project Aria Devices**

Dear Academic Partners,

Mobile Companion app V170 and Aria OS **4970205.890.70** are now available. With the release of Aria OS 4970205.890.70, you can now create time synchronized recordings between multiple devices via the Client SDK.

* Recent documentation improvements include:
    * **Renamed** The Project Aria Tools documentation site has been renamed to reflect its broader scope, it’s now called Project Aria Docs. The Data Utilities section has been renamed to Project Aria Tools.
    * **Updated** [Intro page](/intro.md) and [About ARK](/ARK/about_ARK.mdx)
    * **New** [Project Aria FAQ](/faq.mdx)

### Aria Client SDK (TICSync support and general improvements)

Users can now use the Aria Client SDK to capture time-synchronized data between multiple Project Aria glasses (and potentially other devices) on the one Wi-Fi network via TICSync. Using the Aria hotspot feature, one pair of glasses (server) acts as a Wi-Fi access point that forms a network between all glasses. Time requests from all other glasses go to the server/leader device, creating a synchronized time reference.

* [How to Create Time Synchronized Recordings with Multiple Aria Glasses](/ARK/sdk/ticsync.mdx)
* [TICSync Code Snippet](/ARK/sdk/samples/ticsync_sample.mdx)
* [TICSync Technical Details](/ARK/sdk/concepts/about_ticsync.mdx)

To use TICSync you’ll need to:

* Update to the Aria glasses OS 4970205.750.70, June 28 release
    * Project Aria glasses OS should automatically update when plugged into power and connected to Wi-Fi. Go to [How to Update Your Aria Glasses’ OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) if you want to manually update your glasses.
* Update to Aria Client SDK V1.1
    * [Project Aria Client SDK and CLI Setup Guide](/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx)
    * [Update to the latest version via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/projectaria-client-sdk/)

In addition:

* The Aria Client SDK is now supported on Python 3.12
* Wi-Fi connections to Aria glasses have been made more reliable by enabling sticky connection


#### Known Issues

* The Client SDK is a software developer kit. While we have created code samples to enable a range of features, we have not created fully fledged applications. We encourage people to make this code their own, and to use the code samples as a starting point.

#### Bug Fixes

        * New [Collaborative Tools Page](/collaborative_tools.mdx), did you know you can use Aria data with Nerfstudio? We’ve collaborated with Nerfstudio to enable Gaussian Splatting with their tools.
        * Updated MPS [Google Colab tutorials](/data_utilities/getting_started.mdx#running--jupyter-notebooks-on-google-colab).


### MPS Updates

Once you upload data using the MPS CLI, it will be stored for 30 days for additional processing/reprocessing, instead of 24 hours.


#### New Hand Tracking MPS, Wrist and Palm Tracking

For this new service, we use Aria's SLAM camera images to estimate the hand movements of the wearer. The wrist and palm poses are given in the device frame in meters. These outputs are automatically generated when doing the default MPS CLI request (or request hand_tracking mode) and are listed as Hand Tracking in the Desktop App.

Install Project Aria Tools vs 1.5 using Pip or install Desktop App v38 to be able to request this new service.

* [Hand Tracking Data Format](/data_formats/mps/hand_tracking/hand_tracking.mdx)
* [MPS CLI](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli.mdx)
* [Install/Update Project Aria Tools Using Pip](/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx)
* [Download Desktop app](/ARK/ark_downloads.mdx#desktop-companion-app)


#### Update to Eye Gaze outputs - depth estimations

We have introduced a new model for computing eye gaze, which produces left and right eye gaze directions along with the depth at which these gaze directions intersect.

This new model’s output schema adds to `general_eye_gaze.csv` and `personalized_eye_gaze.csv` in a way that ensures backward compatibility with Project Aria Tools.

* [Eye Gaze Data Formats page](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) - schema has been updated
* [Eye Gaze Code Snippets](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx) - new page


#### Known Issues

* The new Eye Gaze model does not generate `yaw_rads_cpf` outputs
    * This value can be computed using [helper functions](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx#helper) and is automatically read when parsed with our data utilities.


#### Bug Fixes

Minor bug fixes

### Desktop Companion App v38

Download v38 on Windows or MacOS to request Hand Tracking MPS and to get bug fixes.

MPS requests using the Desktop app have been slightly restructured, you no longer need to request Point Cloud data as an additional service. The request options are:

* SLAM (6DoF Trajectory, Semi-Dense Point Cloud, Online Sensor Calibration)
* Eye Gaze (General, plus personalized if the VRS file contains In-Session Eye Gaze Calibration)
* Hand Tracking (Wrist and Palm Tracking)

The Streaming button in the dashboard has been renamed to Preview, to better reflect the capability provided by the Desktop app. Use the [Client SDK with CLI](/ARK/sdk/sdk.mdx) to stream data.

Desktop app logs are now stored in `~/.aria/logs/aria_desktop_app_{date}_{time}.log`

* Please note, the streaming preview available through the Desktop app is optimized for Profile 12.


#### Known Issues

* If you encounter the file too small error when requesting MPS, it may be because the Desktop app is in a bad state. Restarting the app should resolve this issue
* Selecting Cancel does not work when downloading MPS is in progress
* [MacOS] When the app is launched with logging enabled, the Aria icon might not appear in the taskbar, but functions should not be impacted
* [Windows] The Aria icon does not render correctly when pinned to the taskbar


#### Bug Fixes

* If starting recording/streaming fails the UI will now refresh
* Issue where you can’t request MPS unless you interact with tick boxes has been resolved
* Issue where the Desktop app did not quit completely on MacOS has been resolved


### Project Aria Tools v1.5

Project Aria Tools provides open tooling for anyone wanting to work with Aria data. For this release it enables users to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI and provides a new ASR Python code sample.

Update Project Aria Tools:

* Python users: [Update projectaria_tools Python package](/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx)
    * Install via Pip to be able to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI
* C++ users: [Update projectaria_tools git repository](/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase.mdx)

Go to [https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/releases/tag/1.5.0](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/releases/tag/1.5.0) for the full release log.


#### Speech to Text Code Sample (Python)

This new ASR Python code sample shows how to use [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) to run Whisper Speech Recognition on an Aria audio stream. The ASR outputs are time aligned with [Aria Device Time](/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs.mdx#vrs-timestamps-single-device).

Go to the [Automated Speech Recognition Readme](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/samples/python/automated_speech_recognition/Readme.md) for how to get started.

### Aria Glasses OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4968297.250.70** was released on March 11, 2024.


#### New recording profiles

We’ve released the following experimental recording profiles. If you use a new profile, we’d love to hear about how it works for you.

**Recording Profile 26:** Minimal sensors, low RGB frame rate for extended recording times. The aim is 5+ recording hours while having RGB camera data at a low frame rate (unlike Recording Profile 20, which has IMU, but no RGB data).

**Recording Profile 27**: Designed for streaming over USB.

**Recording Profile 28: **Very high Eye Tracking camera frame rate.

**Recording Profile 29:** Low RGB frame rate, JPEG with decimation. This recording profile is the same as Profile 26, however 9 out of every 10 JPEG frames are skipped (decimation/sub-sampling). This is our first recording profile that uses decimation. The data from the RGB data stream is saved at a rate that archives a frame rate of 0.1FPS. The aim of this profile is to be able to record for 15+ hours.

Update to the latest version of the OS to access these profiles. Your glasses’ OS should automatically update when connected to Wi-Fi and power. Go to [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) to manually trigger an update.

You can see more details about recording profiles in the Mobile Companion app:

1. Open the Mobile Companion App and select **New Recording Session**
2. Select the existing recording profile (or Choose Profile if you have not set a default recording profile)
3. Tap **More Info** in the top right corner
    * The More info link may be difficult to see, this will be fixed in a future version of the Mobile Companion app

Or go to [Recording Profiles](/tech_spec/recording_profiles.mdx) documentation in Project Aria Tools.


#### Known Issues

* The new recording profiles are experimental and may be tuned further in the future.


#### Bug Fixes

* Make sure your glasses’ OS is less than 2 months old, to make sure you have a fix for an issue that may cause sluggish behavior in your Aria glasses, difficulties updating the OS, streaming data and reduced upload times.
    * [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) includes troubleshooting steps if you have difficulties updating the OS.


### Mobile Companion App v155

Please keep in mind, you can’t initiate recordings through the Mobile app if your glasses’ OS is more than 2 months old. Please make sure you update your [glasses’ OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx).


#### Updated look and feel of the Mobile app

The Mobile Companion app has a fresh new look! As part of this:

* The Settings tab has been renamed Profile
* Device Settings can be opened by tapping the glasses icon under Paired Glasses

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="80%" src={useBaseUrl('/img/aria_docs/mobile_app_device_settings.png')} alt="Device Settings page from the Dashboard"/>
</div>


#### Known Issues

* The **More info** link on the top right of the Recording Profiles page may be difficult to see.


#### Bug Fixes

Minor bug fixes

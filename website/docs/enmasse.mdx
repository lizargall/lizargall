Content Manager at [En Masse Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_Masse_Entertainment)
- PM, technical writer, and Zendesk administrator for a new support site. Old site had accumulated hundreds of pages over 10 years and was unpleasant to use. Worked with key stakeholders for complete overhaul where some content had significant sentimental attachment.
- Created and maintained Customer Serviceâ€™s wiki in Confluence.
- Created training and policies and procedures that enabled Tier 1 agents overseas perform at Tier 2 levels.
- Technical writer and user support content for the successful launch of Stranger Things 3 and Dark Crystal: Tactics.
- Script writer for Closers patch notes.
    - I worked with Kit Tea Cup to build on her popular brand to create fun short videos to announce season updates and patch releases.

### Closers Patch Notes video

Faced with the challenge of promoting release notes that were complex and often required in-depth game knowledge, I leveraged Kit Tea Cup's brand to write short fun scripts for Closers that even got our beloved Product Manager dancing.

# Liz Argall
Creating empowering documentation and processes; where you need it, when you need it.

Liz Argall is a technical writer, program manager, author and trainer who delivers humanizing, data informed, accessible and technically complex projects for a range of organizations, from Fortune 500 companies to a [Ngombor Community Development Alliance](https://ngombor.org/) in Uganda.

### Documentation is everywhere
[I train, inspire and empower SMEs to create stronger documentation](aria_docs/aria_docs.mdx). Whether the content is for websites, manuals or in the code. Code as documentation will only work if there is adequate documentation in the code! Are your docstrings sufficient? How do you know? Various surveys ([such as MDN Web Developer Needs Assessment](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/12/2020-mdn-web-developer-needs-assessment-now-available/)) have shown that inadequate or outdated documentation is a major pain point for developers. I don't just write documentation, I help developers become documentation champions who can see just how much velocity and extra time they get when code is documented.

### Greenfield or legacy documentation
I use data based decision making, stakeholder engagement and content marketing strategies to create documentation, training and websites. I [break ground](adt/adt.mdx) for new products or [transform old content into revitalized experiences](enmasse.mdx).

### Your organization is unique
I thrive learning about new processes, software, and what matters to your experts and audiences. I produce effective materials for organizations by listening deeply and getting hands-on experience with the products.

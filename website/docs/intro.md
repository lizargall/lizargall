## Aria Data Tools
### Problem
Project Aria was about to do its first ever open data release with accompanying tooling. We had no idea how this project would be received and we had a very small team. 

### Actions
Given how busy our engineers were, I took on creating ourc static website, as well as taking an extremely active role putting together the documentation. Having only been in the role for a month, and never having created a static website before, I quickly leveled up and produced high quality content.

### Outcomes

Tbe open data release was extremely successful and helped inspire many future releases. The documentation was so clear that we ended up not needing to publish a supporting research paper. Everything people needed was in the website. 

Aria Data Tools helped pave the way for Project Aria's even more ambitious project Project Aria Docs.

## Project Aria Docs
### Problem
Aria Data Tools was created in a very small window of time for a specific release. We needed to create a much larger website that catered to multiple audiences. Aria Research Kit documentation that had been behind a sign in was now going to made open source. The site needed to be able to support a lot more tooling, use cases and data releases.

### Actions
Working with a much larger team of SMEs we created Project Aria Docs (originally called Project Aria Tools) within a very tight timeline. This site was then added to and evolved over time. Creating templates to help bring excellence, clarity and consistency to associated content (such as HOT3D readme)

### Outcomes
Enormously positive feedback from our users about the quality of our documentation, especially when compared to other documentation in the field. It is really nice to hear PhD students loudly exclaim "Your documentation is amazing, it saved me!" etc.

Continuing to raise the standard around documentation and having engineers taking templates and principles forward into future projects.

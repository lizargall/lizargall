Welcome to my portfolio. Here are a few suggestions to get you started!

## Technical writing samples:

- [Aria Data Tools Overview](/adt/adt_overview.mdx)
    - Straightforward introduction to Aria Data Tools, from July 2022. The first open tooling we released for working the Aria data.
- [Project Aria FAQ](/aria_docs/faq.mdx)
    - Comprehensive overview of the Project Aria program, from July 2024. The program has evolved a lot in two years and our external documentation serves a much broader audience.
- [Time Synchronized Recordings with Multiple Aria Glasses](/aria_docs/ticsync.mdx)
    - Complex step by step instructions.
- [Audio Troubleshooting for Halo Infinite](https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410860512788-Audio-Troubleshooting-for-Halo-Infinite) (external link)
    - Audio troubleshooting guide for Halo Infinite that included accordions for multiple complex steps.
    - In 2007 I consulted broadly to create what may be the first formal maternity policies and guidelines for a circus in the anglophone world.

## Communications strategy and consulting:
- [The Pulp Stage Case Study](pulp_stage.mdx)
    - Graphic design, marketing and governance consulting.
- <a href="/downloads/circus_maternity_2007.doc">Warehouse Circus Maternity Policy - download .pdf</a>
- <a href="/downloads/acrolinx_ppt.pdf" download>Acrolinx Presentation - download .pdf</a>
    - Example of Acrolinx analysis and demo made for a potential customer, using their own sample documents.
    - See below for a presentation I made at Content Connections in 2018. It describes how we can use AI (Acrolinx) in partnership with human intelligences in powerful ways. Celebrate and support humans to do what they do best, and use computers for what they do best. 
        - Yes, my laugh is a little goofy, but hopefully charming!
        - Yes, I sincerely do get a little verklempt talking about Kim Stanley Robinson and dreams for a better future.

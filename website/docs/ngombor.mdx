# Ngombor Community Development Alliance

I am the co-founder of Ngombor Community Development Alliance in Uganda. Read about our origin story in [What does Ngombor have to do with documentation?](/blog/ngombor).

Ngombor is a community owned and operated non profit based in Uganda. We’re working to create a thriving community hub in Nebbi District that supports sustainable and diverse agriculture and careers in IT.

To be community owned and operated means that Ngombor's leaders are the community members in Nebbi district, Uganda. I provide ideas and resources. I ask questions. I help people see each other and themselves more clearly and make connections. I do a lot of writing and make meaningful introductions.

I manage and develop our international volunteer team (email info@ngombor.org if you'd like to get involved). I get to listen to some brilliant people and have more than a few late night conversations. I hustle for money so that the folks in Uganda have the power to do incredible things.

It's an honor to serve such a dedicated group of community builders and change makers in Northern Uganda.

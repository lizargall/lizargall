# How to Make a Cup of Tea

This tutorial was created using the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). 

Within this framework a [written tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is a carefully constructed learning experience where we try to make up for the fact that the learner and the tutor are not in the same room. In a learning experience, what matters is what the learner does and what happens. It should be opinionated and give the learner a single clear path where the journey is more important than any particular outcome. 

## Your First Cup of Tea

Making a cup of tea can be a fairly straightforward practice that brings pleasure and caffeine to your day or can become an elaborate journey and experience. In this tutorial we’ll take you through the fundamentals of a good cup of tea in a mug using a teabag. 

Go to \[How to Make a Cup of Tea in a Pot\](how to doc link) for more advanced tea making.

We’ll take you through:

## Assembling the materials {#assembling-the-materials}

### The Tea

In this tutorial, we’ll be making a cup of tea using Yorkshire Gold. It's a decent strength black tea. It can taste good with or without milk and it has some coffee-like qualities.

If Yorkshire Gold is not available at your local store, you can (purchase it online)\[affiliate link\].

You can use \[other black teas\](link to Varieties of Tea Explanation page) in this tutorial, however brewing times and how well it works with milk or sugar may vary.

### The Kettle

If you can, get an electric kettle. It’s more energy efficient and less risky. Microwaving hot water in a cup or using an instant hot will not be covered in this tutorial, go to \[Kettles and Kettle Alternatives\](Explanation doc link) for more information.

### The Mug

Because we’re not making the tea in a pot, you’ll need a decent sized mug. Save the actual tea cups for when you’re making a pot of tea.

### Milk and Sugar

When it comes to sugar, stick to white sugar when you’re first starting out, it’s a neutral sweetener that won’t introduce too many variables when you’re getting to know tea.

If you’d like milk with your tea, normal milk is absolutely fine, but if you can get your hands on small farm fresh high quality milk (such as [Tunawerth](https://pacificcoastharvest.com/farmer.php?login=TUNaWERTHDairy)) it will taste much better. 

## Brewing the tea {#brewing-the-tea}

1. Fill the kettle with water  
2. Bring the water to a full boil  
   * For electric kettle, until the kettle shuts off  
   * For stovetop kettle, until the whistle makes a loud sound  
3. Warm the mug by pouring a small amount of hot water into your mug and pouring it out and then set the mug on your countertop or table.  
4. Unwrap the teabag and place the bag in the mug  
   * Keep the paper tab attached to the string outside of the mug  
5. Pour hot water into the mug until it’s one and a half inches below the top  
   * If the tab looks like it might fall into the mug, hold the tab to the outer part of the mug  
6. Use the paper tab to raise and lower the teabag in the mug three times  
7. Set a timer for 5 minutes  
8. After five minutes raise and lower the teabag three times and then remove the teabag from the mug.  
   * For a stronger flavor, squish the teabag with a spoon before removing the bag.

## Enjoying the tea {#enjoying-the-tea}

You have now brewed your first cup of tea. If you have not had black tea before, there are several ways you can customize it and determine the sort of tea you like.

### Try it black (no alterations)

Blow on the hot tea several times to help it cool down and take a small sip, sucking across the surface of the tea. You should get strong notes of tannins and lingering aftertaste.

### Try it with sugar

Add a teaspoon of sugar, stir and sip. With the added sugar it should feel different in your mouth, some of the flavors should come through with a different intensity.

### Try it with milk and sugar

Add a heavy splash of milk or add milk until it’s just below the lip of the mug.

Milk will modify the flavor a lot more than sugar, which is why we’ve saved it to last. The flavors should be quite different and take out some of the sharpness of the tannins, creating a more mellow, rounded experience.

Think about what you like and why and modify to taste.

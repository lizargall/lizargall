A tutorial created with the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). 

Within this framework a [written tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is a carefully constructed learning experience that tries to emulate what it would be like if the learner and the tutor were in the same room. The tutorial should be opinionated and give the learner a single clear path where the journey is more important than any particular outcome. 

## Your first cup of tea

Making a cup of tea can be a simple practice that brings pleasure and caffeine to your day or can become an elaborate journey and experience. In this takes you through the fundamentals of making a good cup of tea with a teabag in a mug. 

Go to \[How to Make a Cup of Tea in a Pot\](how to doc link) for more advanced ways to make tea.

This tutorial covers:

* [Brew the tea](#brewing-the-tea)

## Assemble the materials {#assembling-the-materials}

### The tea

This tutorial uses Yorkshire Gold. It's a strong black tea that can taste good with or without milk.

If Yorkshire Gold is not available at your local store, you can (purchase it online)\[affiliate link\].

You can use \[other black teas\](link to Varieties of Tea page) in this tutorial. Brewing time and how well it works with milk or sugar may vary.

### The kettle

If you can, get an electric kettle. It’s more energy efficient and less risky. Microwaving hot water in a cup or using an instant-hot will not be covered in this tutorial, go to \[Kettles and Kettle Alternatives\](Explanation doc link) for more information.

### The mug

Because you're not making the tea in a pot, you’ll need a decent sized mug. Save the actual tea cups for pots of tea.

### Milk and sugar

When it comes to sugar, stick to white sugar at first. It’s a neutral sweetener that won’t introduce too many variables while you get to know tea.

If you’d like milk with your tea, normal milk is fine, but if you can get your hands on small farm fresh high quality milk (such as [Tunawerth](https://pacificcoastharvest.com/farmer.php?login=TUNaWERTHDairy)) the tea will taste much better. 

## Brew the tea {#brewing-the-tea}

1. Fill the kettle with water
2. Bring the water to a full boil  
   * For electric kettle, until the kettle shuts off  
   * For stovetop kettle, until the whistle makes a loud sound  
3. Pour a small amount of hot water into the mug, wait a moment and pour it out again
    * This will warm the mug
4. Set the mug on your counter top or table  
4. Unwrap the teabag, and place the bag in the mug  
   * Keep the paper tab attached to the string outside of the mug  
5. Pour hot water into the mug until it’s one and a half inches below the top  
   * If the tab looks like it might fall into the mug, hold the tab to the outer part of the mug  
6. Use the paper tab to raise and lower the teabag in the mug at least three times  
7. Set a timer for 5 minutes  
8. After five minutes raise and lower the teabag at least three times, and then remove the teabag from the mug  
   * For a stronger flavor, squish the teabag with a spoon before removing the bag

## Enjoy the tea {#enjoying-the-tea}

You have now brewed your first cup of tea. If you have not had black tea before there are several ways you can customize it to determine how you like your tea.

### Try black tea (no alterations)

Blow on the hot tea several times to help it cool down, and take a small sip. You should get strong notes of tannins and lingering aftertaste.

### Try tea with sugar

Add a teaspoon of sugar, stir and sip. The added sugar should make the tea feel different in your mouth, as well as express different flavors.

### Try tea with milk and sugar

Add a heavy splash of milk, or add milk until it’s just below the lip of the mug.

Milk will modify the flavor a lot more than sugar. The flavors should be quite different and take out some of the sharpness of the tannins, creating a more mellow, rounded experience.

Think about what you like and why, and modify to taste.

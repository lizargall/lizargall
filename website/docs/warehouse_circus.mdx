# Warehouse Circus Policies and Procedures
[Warehouse Circus](https://warehousecircus.org.au/about/) is a youth training circus in Canberra, Australia. It is recognized as a Key Arts organization, a cultural  organization that is recognized as have a key role in the cultural life of the Australian Capital Territory. 

In 2006-2007 I served on the Warehouse Circus board, first as a director and then as Secretary. In 2007 I stepped down from the board to serve as Interim General Manager after an externally induced crisis. I worked with an exceptional board to navigate the circus through this crisis, helped the circus find a new home and secure funding to support this move. I lead the recruitment process for finding a new manager (as I was moving to America in six months).

    - In 2007 I consulted with SMEs to create what may be the first formal maternity policies and guidelines for a circus in the anglophone world

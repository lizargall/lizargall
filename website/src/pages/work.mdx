# Work With Me

**Status:** Open to work

I recently completed an assignment helping Microsoft datacenters prepare for the [European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive](https://blog.se.com/datacenter/2024/02/07/the-eu-energy-efficiency-directive-and-its-impact-on-cios-data-centre-owners-and-operators/) reporting requirements. I provided a documentation roadmap for a team critical for reporting requirements and equipped developers with the templates and skills necessary to create their documentation. This will help the team be well prepared for audit requirements Microsoft must pass if they are to have data centers in Europe.

I'm now looking for my next assignment (or long term home). I have experience as a sole contributor as well as managing paid or volunteer staff. I believe in servant leadership and enjoy getting into the thick of things. Weeding a garden and designing a garden have their own distinct pleasures. When it comes to collaboration I like to use Agile, Open Source and Permaculture philosophies. 

## Short term contracts/freelance
My service offerings include:
* Coaching and mentoring for solo technical writers and small non profits.
    * This includes creating, training, road maps and plans for any of the services I provide in the long term/full time section.
* Public speaking and presentations.
* Small technical writing projects.

## Long term/full time 
* Extensive experience maturing scrappy projects with big dreams and tiny budgets.
* Knowledge base creation or migration.
* Volunteer engagement and membership development.
* Creating and facilitating continual quality improvement plans.
* Building strong documentation workplace cultures.
* Operationalizing research/prototype product delivery.
* Distilling the expertise of subject matter experts into documentation and training.
* Change management and staff development.

## What next?

If I'm not the right fit for your project, don't worry, it's still great to have a chat. We can both be upfront about we're looking for and I love to help people find the right match.

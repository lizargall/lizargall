# Work With Me

**Status:** Available in January 2026

I'm currently working on an HR content migration project at Meta. It's a short term contract that concludes in December. Before that I completed an assignment helping Microsoft datacenters prepare for the [European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive](https://blog.se.com/datacenter/2024/02/07/the-eu-energy-efficiency-directive-and-its-impact-on-cios-data-centre-owners-and-operators/) reporting requirements.

January is not far away, so I'm looking for my next assignment (or long term home). I have experience as a sole contributor as well as managing paid or volunteer staff. I believe in servant leadership and enjoy getting into the thick of things. Weeding a garden and designing a garden have their own distinct pleasures. When it comes to collaboration I like to use Agile, Open Source and Permaculture philosophies. 

## Short term contracts/freelance
My service offerings include:
* Coaching and mentoring for solo technical writers and small nonprofits.
    * This includes creating, training, road maps and plans for any of the services I provide in the long term/full time section.
* Public speaking and presentations.
* Small technical writing projects.

## Long term/full time 
* Extensive experience maturing scrappy projects with big dreams and tiny budgets.
* Knowledge base creation or migration.
* Volunteer engagement and membership development.
* Creating and facilitating continual quality improvement plans.
* Building strong documentation workplace cultures.
* Operationalizing research/prototype product delivery.
* Distilling the expertise of subject matter experts into documentation and training.
* Change management and staff development.

## What next?
Contact me at liz@lizargall.com to explore possible collaborations. 

If I'm not the right fit for your project, don't worry, it's still great to have a chat. We can both be upfront about we're looking for and I love to help people find the right match.

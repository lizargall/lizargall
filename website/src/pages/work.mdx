# Work With Me

**Status:** Available in July 2026

My current short term contract concludes in July 2026. Before that I completed an assignment helping Microsoft datacenters prepare for the [European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive](https://blog.se.com/datacenter/2024/02/07/the-eu-energy-efficiency-directive-and-its-impact-on-cios-data-centre-owners-and-operators/) reporting requirements.

July is not far away, so I'm looking for my next assignment (or long term home). I have experience as a sole contributor as well as managing paid or volunteer staff. I believe in servant leadership and enjoy getting into the thick of things. Weeding a garden and designing a garden have their own distinct pleasures. When it comes to collaboration I like to use Agile, open source and permaculture philosophies. 

## Short term contracts/freelance
My service offerings include:
* Coaching and mentoring for solo technical writers and small nonprofits
    * This includes creating, training, road maps and plans for any of the services I provide in the long term/full time section
* Non-profit consulting, including board development, volunteer engagement and telling your organization's story
* Small technical writing projects (where they do not conflict with my current work at Meta)
* Public speaking and presentations

## Long term/full time
With my background with non-profits and IT I have a pretty nifty skill set. This includes:
* Extensive experience maturing scrappy projects with big dreams and tiny budgets
* Knowledge base creation or migration
* Volunteer engagement and membership development
* Creating and facilitating continual quality improvement plans
* Building strong documentation workplace cultures
* Operationalizing research/prototype product delivery
* Distilling the expertise of subject matter experts into documentation and training
* Change management and staff development

Fun fact, my last job in Australia (moved to America in 2009) was managing a youth circus! So a little organized chaos doesn't scare me ;-).

## What next?
Contact me at liz@lizargall.com to explore possible collaborations. 

If I'm not the right fit for your project, don't worry, it's still great to have a chat. We can both be upfront about we're looking for and I love to help people find the right match.
